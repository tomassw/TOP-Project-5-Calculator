# TOP-Project-5-Calculator

This is a clean looking (I hope) minimal calculator.

The code is 100% genuine, I am very proud of this. I am finally getting the hang of flexbox and grid and also javascript feels now like second nature (thanks C# and C++).

Its functionality is not out of this world, but at least it has a Light Theme/Dark Theme switcher.
